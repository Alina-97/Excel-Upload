User Interface: Using HTML and Bootstrap, I tried to create a simple, clear design for the user interface. I made a straightforward design with a large file upload button. I was able to efficiently arrange the pieces and guarantee responsiveness on a variety of screen sizes thanks to Bootstrap's grid framework.


File Processing: The management of file input was greatly aided by JavaScript. I read the file straight in the browser when a user picks it, avoiding server-side processing, by using the FileReader API. This made the user experience smooth and effective. I used tools like SheetJS for Excel parsing and PapaParse for CSV parsing to handle both CSV and Excel files. 

Data Display: To show the content, I dynamically created an HTML table after reading and processing the file. I parsed the data from CSV files using PapaParse so that each object represented a row in the table. In a similar vein, SheetJS assisted with the extraction of data from Excel files, which was subsequently transformed into an array format that supported table presentation. I made sure the table was flexible and scalable by utilising JavaScript to generate it dynamically. 

Styling: The table and the overall website layout were styled using CSS and Bootstrap. My goal was to create a design that was both aesthetically pleasing and responsive on many devices. I tailored Bootstrap's standard styles and components to match the application's aesthetics, and they served as a strong basis. The layout and design components were further refined using CSS .
Version Control: Git was used, adhering to recommended practices such frequent commits with informative messages, for version control. This made it easier to track changes throughout the development process. Using GitHub's collaborative tools, I was able to issue tracking. 

In summary, my goal was to develop a front-end application that is both user-friendly utilising JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to display and upload CSV or Excel files. I also made sure that best practices for file processing, data display, styling, and version control were followed.
